> ‚ö°Ô∏è **Stealthy, Spoofing, Anti-Detection Traceroute for Advanced Pentesters & Red Teams**


---

**stalkroute** is an advanced, stealth-focused for tracing the whole routeno more hiding the traceroute tool for ethical hackers, red teams, and penetration testers.  
It stalks the network path to a target while evading firewalls, detection systems, and network monitoring.

- üö© **Bypasses firewalls and rate-limiters with randomized probes**
- ü¶ë **Spoofs source IP and mimics common OS packet signatures**
- üé≠ **Rotates protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP SYN ‚Äî not just boring ICMP**
- üîç **Detects and reports blocked, filtered, or stealthed hops**
- üïµÔ∏è **Anti-detection: jitter, decoy payloads, randomized timing**
- üíæ **Fully open source, customizable for your ops**

---

## Features

- **Stealth Probing**: Random source port, ID, TTL, TOS, and timing
- **Protocol Obfuscation**: Each hop may receive ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets
- **Source IP Spoofing**: Internal subnet spoof support (root required)
- **Detection Evasion**: Jitter between probes, randomized OS fingerprints, and more
- **Blocked Hop Reporting**: Clearly shows which hops are filtered or blocked
- **Interactive**: Asks for a target on startup
- **Colorful Output**: Easy to follow, real-time results

## Demo

```

sudo python3 stalkroute.py

\[?] Enter the target IP or domain: example.com
\[+] Traceroute to example.com (max 30 hops)
\[\*] Resolved example.com to 93.184.216.34
\[TTL= 1] 192.168.1.1      time-exceeded (icmp) 0.8ms
\[TTL= 2] 197.155.24.1     time-exceeded (udp) 1.2ms
\[TTL= 3] BLOCKED / FILTERED
\[TTL= 4] 41.13.62.241     time-exceeded (tcp) 7.7ms
...
\[+] Target reached: 93.184.216.34

## Install

```
pip install scapy colorama
````

---

## Usage

```
sudo python3 stalkroute.py
```

**Note:**

* Must be run as root for raw socket spoofing and source IP spoofing.
* Works on Linux, macOS (with sudo), WSL2 (with limitations).

---

## Options

* Edit the config at the top of `stalkroute.py` to tune:

  * `MAX_TTL`: Maximum hops to scan
  * `PROBE_COUNT`: Number of probes per hop
  * `JITTER_RANGE`: Stealth delay between probes
  * `DECOY_PROB`: Probability to send non-ICMP probes
  * `SPOOF_SRC_IP`: Spoof internal IP (e.g. `192.168.1.222`), or leave `None`
  * `USE_RANDOM_OS_SIG`: Emulate random OS fingerprints for each probe
